# About this book

This book describes how to use R statistics as a tool for working with data.  

R statistics is becoming increasingly popular for data management and analysis due to its accessibility and versatility. For example, R can produce records of data analyses, which is consistent with the growing move towards reproducible and open science within the field of psychology. R statistics is also known for making elegant graphs, which can help develop data visualization skills. Because it is open-sourced it is extremely flexible - people create and share packages that make certain aspects of data analysis easy.  

R is a programming language. Although learning a programming language can seem a bit intimidating, there are many benefits to trying to figure it out. Mastering the basics of R could be useful for your future coursework, as well as for data management and analysis needs outside the classroom (independent research, future employment, etc.). That is to say, Learning the basics of a programming language is a highly transferable skill.  

The R programming language can be used within the R software as well as other programs. RStudio is a IDE (integrated development environment) and was designed to make the use of the R programming language more user friendly.  

R, and its companion program RStudio, are free and available in PC, Mac, and Linux versions, so students can have it on their own computer - eliminating the need to visit computer labs or to buy student versions of expensive software. R can be downloaded from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) (https://www.r-project.org/). Rstudio can be found here: https://rstudio.com/.  

While you are welcome to download R and Rstudio on your personal computer, you do not have to for this course. We will be using Rstudio on a website called Rstudio cloud for class work (this is discussed in more detail in the next chapter). So I am not going to go into detail on downloading the programs on to your computer here. Please email me if you are interested in this and are having a hard time figuring it out.  

Finally, please note that I will be updating this book over the course of the semester.
