\hypertarget{set-up-project-on-rstudio-cloud}{%
\chapter{Set up project on Rstudio Cloud}\label{set-up-project-on-rstudio-cloud}}

First expand the R studio cloud options by clicking on the 3 lines in the top left corner.

\includegraphics{img/Picture1.png}

Then select PSYC 211 for the current semester. If you cannot see this option -- then you have not been added to our shared workspace. See the Introduction to R -- overview (start here) html site on this week's D2L site for instructions on how to get into our shared workspace.

Once you are in the shared PSYC 211 workspace, open a new project and title it with your last name by clicking on the box that says `Untitled Project' and typing your last name.

\includegraphics{img/Projname.png}

I will be able to see everyone's project. But you will only be able to see your project and my project.

\hypertarget{getgitbook}{%
\chapter{Get your GitBook}\label{getgitbook}}

Test.

To get your GitBook, you should follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to \url{https://github.com/cjvanlissa/gitbook-demo}
\item
  In the top right of the page, click \texttt{Fork}.\\
  This will copy my \texttt{gitbook-demo} repository to your GitHub account.\\
  \includegraphics{./img/settings.png}
\item
  My repository is now copied to your account. It is a template repository, which means that you can create a \emph{new repository} based on this one.
\item
  Create a new repository for your own GitBook. Create one for a course you've been wanting to update. In the top-right corner of the GitHub website, click the + icon, and select ``New repository'':\\
  \includegraphics{./img/new_repo.png}
\item
  In the dialog, select the \texttt{gitbook-demo} as ``Repository template'', and give the repository an appropriate name for your course. Then, press \texttt{Create\ repository}:\\
  \includegraphics{./img/from_template.png}
\item
  Now, go back to Rstudio on your computer. In Rstudio, click \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ New\ Project}. A dialog will open. If you set up Rstudio with Git correctly, the dialog should have an option to create a new project from Version control. Click it:\\
  \includegraphics{./img/new_project.png}
\item
  In the next dialog window, you should copy the URL of the GitHub repository you created in \emph{Step 5}, like so:\\
  \includegraphics{./img/new_git_project.png}
\item
  Now, in Rstudio, you can open files for editing and create new files (explained in the next Chapter). Open files by clicking them in the Files editor (usually in the bottom right of Rstudio):\\
  \includegraphics{./img/files_editor.png}
\item
  After you make a change, it will show up in the Git tab (usually in the top right of Rstudio). You must Commit the change locally, and then Push the change to GitHub to update your repo. To Commit, select the file and click the Commit button. Write a short message to describe the changes you made, then click the Commit button again. Now, press Push to send your commits to GitHub.\\
  \includegraphics{./img/commit_push.png}
\item
  To render your book as a GitBook, you must ``Build'' it. In the top-right panel of Rstudio, you see a ``Build'' tab. In this tab, simply click the ``Build Book'' button to build your book. You should see a lot of rendering messages, until a window pops up with your brand new GitBook. If you get errors at this stage, you probably made a mistake in preparing your system (see the previous Chapter).\\
  \includegraphics{./img/build_book.png}
\item
  Building the book generated a lot of new files in the \texttt{./docs} directory. This directory contains the website files for your GitBook. Open the Git tab again, verify that the \texttt{./docs} directory is listed, and Commit and Push all of these new files as described in \emph{Step 9}.
\item
  There is only one last remaining task: To publish your GitBook on GitHub pages. Once you do this, any change to the \texttt{./docs} folder that you push to GitHub will lead to an immediate update of your GitBook website. Go back to the GitHub page for your Repository. Click on the \texttt{Settings} tab on the top right of the page:\\
  \includegraphics{./img/settings.png}
\item
  On the Settings page, scroll all the way down until you reach a section called \texttt{GitHub\ Pages}. There, under the ``Source'' heading, click the word \texttt{None}, and select \texttt{master\ branch\ /docs\ folder}. When you select it, the page will update, and if you scroll back down to the \texttt{GitHub\ Pages} section, you will see the URL where your GitBook is published. The first time, it will take a few minutes for your GitBook to come online. When you publish updates to the GitBook however (simply by following \emph{Step 11} again), the update will be near-instantaneous. The Pages section should now look like this (and that is hopefully the link where you found this book):\\
  \includegraphics{./img/pages_published.png}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{editing-the-book}{%
\chapter{Editing the book}\label{editing-the-book}}

The contents of the book are written in \textbf{RMarkdown}. You can use any formatting code that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\). Moreover, you can include chunks of R-code, like this:

The results of these chunks can be rendered to the GitBook:

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "This is an R-command!"
\end{verbatim}

To edit the book, you can change the text in the \texttt{.Rmd} files. Each Rmd file should contain \textbf{one and only one} chapter. A chapter is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}, e.g., \texttt{\#\ Editing\ the\ book}.

Any sub-headings within the chapter are indicated with several \texttt{\#} signs, e.g., \texttt{\#\#} (level 2) and \texttt{\#\#\#} (level 3).

\hypertarget{creating-new-chapters}{%
\section{Creating new chapters}\label{creating-new-chapters}}

To create a new chapter, you must follow two steps: 1) Create the file, and 2) Include it in the list of chapters.

First, to create the file for a new chapter in Rstudio, click \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ New\ File\ \textgreater{}\ Text\ file}. At the top of the file, write your chapter heading, as explained above. Then, click \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ Save}. Save the file as \texttt{.Rmd}, without spaces in the file name, e.g.: \texttt{editing\_the\_book.Rmd}.

Second, to include it in the list of chapters, open the file \texttt{\_bookdown.yml} (click it in the Files explorer in the bottom right of Rstudio). This file has a list of \texttt{.Rmd} files to be included in the book. In this example, the list looks like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{tmp <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{readLines}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"_bookdown.yml"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{cat}\NormalTok{(tmp[}\KeywordTok{grep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"^rmd_files"}\NormalTok{, tmp)}\OperatorTok{:}\KeywordTok{grep}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"references}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}\StringTok{.Rmd"}\NormalTok{, tmp)], }\DataTypeTok{sep =} \StringTok{"}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

rmd\_files: {[}``index.Rmd'',
``Introduction.Rmd'',
``setuprstudiocloud.Rmd'',
``get\_your\_gitbook.Rmd'',
``editing\_the\_book.Rmd'',
``figures\_tables.Rmd'',
``examples.Rmd'',
``open\_educational.Rmd'',
``use\_in\_course.Rmd'',
``licenses.Rmd'',
``references.Rmd''{]}

Insert the file name of your new chapter in the desired position in this list.

\hypertarget{linking-across-chapters}{%
\section{Linking across chapters}\label{linking-across-chapters}}

You can label chapter and section titles using \texttt{\{\#label\}} after them. The labels can be used as cross-references. For example, we can link to Chapter \ref{figtab}. If you do not manually label chapters, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \ref{examples}.

\hypertarget{advanced-editing}{%
\section{Advanced editing}\label{advanced-editing}}

The convenient \href{https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf}{Rmarkdown Cheat Sheet} by Rstudio covers most of the knowledge required for advanced Rmarkdown editing. You can print it out and stick it to your wall!

\hypertarget{figtab}{%
\chapter{Figures and tables}\label{figtab}}

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environments, respectively.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{par}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mar =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{.1}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{.1}\NormalTok{))}
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(pressure, }\DataTypeTok{type =} \StringTok{'b'}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{pch =} \DecValTok{19}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Tools-for-Analyzing-Data_files/figure-latex/nice-fig-1} 

}

\caption{Here is a nice figure!}\label{fig:nice-fig}
\end{figure}

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the \texttt{fig:} prefix, e.g., see Figure \ref{fig:nice-fig}. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from \texttt{knitr::kable()}, e.g., see Table \ref{tab:nice-tab}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{kable}\NormalTok{(}
  \KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{(iris, }\DecValTok{20}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{caption =} \StringTok{'Here is a nice table!'}\NormalTok{,}
  \DataTypeTok{booktabs =} \OtherTok{TRUE}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:nice-tab}Here is a nice table!}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{rrrrl}

5.1 & 3.8 & 1.5 & 0.3 & setosa\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the \textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015}.

This book provides a short and to-the-point exposition on the essentials of statistics, and was written for undergraduate students at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). To a lesser degree, the mathematical modeling of statistical questions will be addressed. This book might be relevant for Portuguese-speaking students who enroll for laboratory-based statistics and anyone who wants to learn R.

\hypertarget{open-educational-resources}{%
\chapter{Open Educational Resources}\label{open-educational-resources}}

UNESCO defines Open Educational Resources as \href{https://en.unesco.org/themes/building-knowledge-societies/oer}{\emph{teaching, learning and research materials in any medium -- digital or otherwise -- that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.}}

Open Educational resources can help lighten the workload on individual teachers, who can collaborate with the development of high-quality open access resources, instead of having to develop their own proprietary materials from scratch. Moreover, Open Educational resources are inclusive, lowering the barrier to knowledge acquisition for learners around the world, and enabling lifelong learning for those outside academia.

Many universities support Open Educational Resources. Here are just a few (feel free to \href{https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request}{send a pull request} with other relevant resources).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  \href{https://uu.figshare.com/}{\textbf{Utrecht University Figshare}}: Open learning objects from Utrecht University.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{compatibility-with-existing-systems}{%
\chapter{Compatibility with existing systems}\label{compatibility-with-existing-systems}}

Many universities offer digital platforms for learning. You might wish to embed your GitBook within these existing systems. Here are two ways in which you might do that. Currently, this section only discusses BlackBoard, but the same principles should apply to other platforms.

\hypertarget{add-a-hyperlink}{%
\section{Add a hyperlink}\label{add-a-hyperlink}}

You can add a link to your GitBook in the BlackBoard course menu by following \href{https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Course_Content/Create_Content/Create_Course_Materials/Link_to_Websites}{this tutorial}.

\hypertarget{embed-the-whole-book}{%
\section{Embed the whole book}\label{embed-the-whole-book}}

You can add a Blank Page to your BlackBoard course menu, and fill that page with a full-size ``iframe'' - a web page within the web page. \href{https://mycampus.maine.edu/web/uc-faculty-portal/education-technology/-/asset_publisher/vEKuFJYvDY5K/content/inserting-an-iframe-into-blackboard?inheritRedirect=false}{This tutorial} explains how to do it. It is possible that your university is blocking this feature, however.

\hypertarget{license-your-gitbook}{%
\chapter{License your GitBook}\label{license-your-gitbook}}

In the spirit of Open Science, it is good to think about making your course materials Open Source. That means that other people can use them. In principle, if you publish materials online without license information, you hold the copyright to those materials. If you want them to be Open Source, you must include a license. It is not always obvious what license to choose.

The Creative Commons licenses are typically suitable for course materials. This GitBook, for example, is licensed under CC-BY 4.0. That means you can use and remix it as you like, but you must credit the original source.

If your project is more focused on software or source code, consider using the \href{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html}{GNU GPL v3 license} instead.

You can find \href{https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-examples}{more information about the Creative Commons Licenses here}. Specific licenses that might be useful are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/}{CC0 (``No Rights Reserved'')}, everybody can do what they want with your work.
\item
  \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}{CC-BY 4.0 (``Attribution'')}, everybody can do what they want with your work, but they must credit you. Note that this license may not be suitable for software or source code!
\end{itemize}
